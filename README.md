# Nothing-Remains
Nothing remains is a short and atmospheric survival horror about your own impermanance in the endless flow of time. 

In the year of 20XX, much of the planet has become dry and barren. As global pollution never stopped, many speices of animal have gone exinct along with many crop species as well. The wage gap is a vast ocean from rich to poor. the world's most wealthy philanthropist launches their new venture into quantum-accelerated crop growth to produce 10x more food at just 1/10th the space currently used. 

Taking the role of a nameless security guard, you find yourself in the center of catastrophe when during a routine stop to the labs, a machine goes haywire and opens a portal to the past. The past is set in a medieval castle perched atop the same one te facility is built into.
